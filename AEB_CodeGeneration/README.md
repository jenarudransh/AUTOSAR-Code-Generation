# AUTOSAR Code Generation Output

This directory (`AEB_CodeGeneration`) serves as the output folder for the AUTOSAR-compliant code generated from the Simulink models (like `AEB.CodeGeneration.slx`) located in the project's root directory.

## Sub-Directory Contents

This folder contains the following key sub-directories, which are automatically generated by the build and code generation process:

* **`AEB_CodeGeneration_autosar_rtw/`**
    * **Purpose:** This is the primary build directory (from Real-Time Workshop / Embedded Coder) that contains the final generated source code.
    * **Key Contents:** Inside, you will find the AUTOSAR-compliant C source files (`.c`) and header files (`.h`). These files are the software implementation of your Simulink model, ready to be integrated into an AUTOSAR stack.

* **`slprj/`**
    * **Purpose:** This is a Simulink-generated directory for project cache and intermediate build artifacts.
    * **Key Contents:** It stores object files (`.o`), mex files, and other cached data used by Simulink and the Embedded Coder to speed up simulations and subsequent code generation builds.

### :warning: **Important Note** :warning:

The contents of this entire directory are **auto-generated**.

**Do not manually edit any files** within `AEB_CodeGeneration_autosar_rtw` or `slprj`. Any manual changes will be overwritten the next time the code generation process is run from the Simulink models.
